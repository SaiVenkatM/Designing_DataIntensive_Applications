While relational databases efficiently use joins to link tables by IDs, document databases avoid joins for one-to-many structures and have limited join support. If joins are unsupported, the application must perform multiple queries, effectively handling the join in the application code. For small, stable lists like regions and industries, the application might keep them in memory, shifting the join workload from the database to the application.\n",

You can easily query, insert, and update data without worrying about foreign key relationships. The query optimizer automatically determines the execution order and index usage for queries, reducing the need for developers to manage access paths. Adding new indexes allows queries to adapt without changes. Despite the complexity of query optimizers, their one-time development benefits all applications, making it easier to add new features and ultimately providing a more efficient, general-purpose solution.*\n",

    "However, when it comes to representing many-to-one and many-to-many relation‐ ships, relational and document databases are not fundamentally different: in both cases, the related item is referenced by a unique identifier, which is called a foreign key in the relational model and a document reference in the document model. That identifier is resolved at read time by using a join or follow-up queries. To date, document databases have not followed the path of CODASYL(Network Model).*\n"

    "- *It’s worth pointing out that the idea of grouping related data together for locality is not limited to the document model.*\n",
